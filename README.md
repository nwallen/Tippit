# Pre-work - *Tippit*

**Tippit** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nicholas Wallen**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [X] Add helptext to bill field.
* [X] Apply currency formatting to bill, tip and total amounts.

## Notes

Xcode errors are really hard to understand â€” I had a few instances in which the project would not build because I changed an outlet variable name in code, but the storyboard still had a reference to the old variable (I suppose?).
